# AguilarFRestaurantPickerEndpoint

// Opening the file AguilarFRestaurantPickerEndpoint in vs code, turn on the debug feture and let it run. Once it has finished running the
// localhost page will show up and say it can't be found. Return to the debug console in vs sharp and copy + paste the http url ( example: http://localhost:5250 ).
// Open up Postman in your web browser and create a new http request. Paste the http into the request. You type in / and then the name of the controller
// including what goes in after the route in parenthesis. With another dash you input the value you wish for {foodChoice}.
// As it states in vs code, you must choose one of three options. Either mexican, chinese or american. Enter send and the url should output into postman
// a randomized response {foodChoice} giving you a restaurant from the food type you chose! Try hitting send again and see your options!
